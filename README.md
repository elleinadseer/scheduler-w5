## Development

I struggled with this task a lot. The CSS side of things was easy to complete; however the aspects involving local storage and array usage were things I really struggled with. I will have to read more into the subjects to increase my fluency with these ideas. I wanted to make the website look as close to the example provided, while I recognise it was not a requirement, but I had to remove certain features of the original as I couldn't work out how to implement the clear highscores function. I find this regretful and want to work harder to overcome this.
