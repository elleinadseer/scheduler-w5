# scheduler-w5
## Description

I have been tasked to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day - I have utilised jQuery and the day.js library in order to do this. The time blocks change colour dependent on the time of day (which is informed by referring to day.js) and hour-specific messages are saved to and redeemed from local storage.

## Development

This task when a lot more smoothly than the last task - it was easier to weave together the logic of jQuery, day.js and local storage, I feel my understanding of these subjects is increasing but more specific intricacies like parseInt and this were complex. I especially want to gain a better understanding of this - while I believe I utilised it correctly in this task I'd like to feel more confident in my usage.
